is git rebase?
Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.

rebase example :
git checkout feature
git rebase master
This operation moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the master branch which incorporates all new commits in master. Instead of merging, git rebasing re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.
